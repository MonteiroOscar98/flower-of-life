# Flower of Life - Python Visualization  

This repository contains a **Python implementation** of the **Flower of Life**, a beautiful and intricate geometric pattern made of overlapping circles. Using **Matplotlib** and **NumPy**, we generate and visualize the pattern in a structured hexagonal grid.

## Features  
- 📏 **Mathematical Accuracy** – Uses hexagonal tiling to accurately replicate the Flower of Life.  
- 🎨 **Customizable Parameters** – Adjust the number of circles (`n`) and radius to explore variations.  
- 📊 **Matplotlib Visualization** – Generates clear, structured plots.  
- 🚀 **Fun & Educational** – Great for learning about geometry, patterns, and Python visualization.
