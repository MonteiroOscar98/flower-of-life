# Flower of Life - Python Visualization  

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Flower of Life**, a beautiful and intricate geometric pattern made of overlapping circles. Using **Matplotlib** and **NumPy**, we generate, visualize, and animate the pattern in a structured hexagonal grid.  

## Features  

- 📏 **Mathematical Accuracy** – Uses hexagonal tiling to accurately replicate the Flower of Life.  
- 🎨 **Customizable Parameters** – Adjust the number of circles (`n`) and radius to explore variations.  
- 📊 **Matplotlib Visualization** – Generates clear, structured plots for geometric exploration.  
- 🎥 **Animated Drawing** – Watch the Flower of Life come to life with smooth circle-by-circle animation.  
- 🚀 **Fun & Educational** – Great for learning about geometry, patterns, and Python visualization.
